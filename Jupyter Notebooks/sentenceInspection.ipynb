assessed at fair value through profit or loss: Assets that are held to collect the contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and for which the cash flows represent exclusi- vely interest and principal payments, are measured at fair value through equity.\n","When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is

Steuerberatungsgesellschaft Behrendt Wirtschaftsprueferin (Auditor) Riedhammer Wirtschaftspruefer (Auditor) 69 Auditor’s Report 70 Annual report 2021 Based on detailed management reports, all business cases significant and essential for the M+M group have been discussed in depth, also concerning the development of the individual subsidiaries.\n","71 Administrative Board Report The annual report of Mensch und Maschine Software SE as of December 31, 2021, as well as the group annual report as of December 31, 2021, including the management report for the group was set up by the Managing Directors and audited by RSM GmbH Wirtschaftsprue- fungsgesellschaft Steuerberatungsgesell- schaft (auditing firm), Stuttgart, and endorsed with an unqualified audit opinion.\n","The Administrative Board reviewed the annual report and group annual report, the manage- ment and group management report and the Managing Directors’ suggestion for the use of the net income for the year, and agreed to the annual report and group annual report, raising no objections after its own review.\n","Wessling, March 2022 The Administrative Board Adi Drotleff Chairman The Administrative Board received reports about the development of the risk management system; existing risks and their provision were explained by the Managing Directors.\n","The Board of Managing Directors (‘Geschäfts - führende Direktoren’), equalling the ‘Vorstand’ of a German AG without being a legal body (‘Organ’), consists of Adi Drotleff, Christoph Aschenbrenner (COO) and Markus Pech (CFO).\n","With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial investments, loan notes and certain derivative instruments, the exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.\n","Our clear future target is to continue this way of sustainable and profitable growth: For 2022 we expect 144-150 Cents/share (+14-19%) net profit and plan to pay out a 135-140 Cents dividend.\n","Our mid-term goal is to double earnings in 4-5 years, hence to achieve >250 Cents net earnings per share until the year 2025 or 2026 - of course organic and in continuing our present dividend policy of nearly full payout to our shareholders.\n","Particularly in the highly complex 5-axis milling process, the hyperMILL and hyper- CAD S product lines from OPEN MIND hold a technologically leading position and allow the customers quick payback of their high machine tool investments, which are typically in the six to seven digit range.\n","It cannot be excluded, however, that the refinancing interest rate payable by M+M may develop negatively or the refinancing by debt may fail in parts or in total.\n","Dividend proposal 120 Cents (+20%) Management will propose to the annual shareholders’ meeting on May 11, 2022 to pay 120 Cents (PY: 100) dividend per share.\n","9% 1,1150 16,783 *see notes on pages 46 to 48 Amounts in KEUR Net result after taxes thereof attributable to M+M shareholders thereof attributable to minority shareholders Currency

the ‘management approach’.\n","36 Annual report 2021 Management maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.\n","When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts, management bases its estimates on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write-off experience, customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms.\n","Subsequent measurement depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset: - About amortized costs: Assets that are held to collect the contractual cash flows, and for which these cash flows represent exclusively interest and principal payments, are measured at amortized cost.\n","- Financial assets assessed at fair value through profit or loss: Assets that are held to collect the contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and for which the cash flows represent exclusi- vely interest and principal payments, are measured at fair value through equity.\n","The lease liabilities include the following lease payments: – Fixed payments, less lease incentives to be paid by the lessor; – variable lease payments that are based on an index or an interest rate; – expected amounts to be payable by the les- see under residual value guarantees; – the exercise price of a purchase option, if the exercise is reasonably certain and – payment of penalties for the termination of the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\n","Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, which are comprised as follows: – Lease liability, – lease payments made at or before the com- mencement date less any lease incentives received, – initial direct costs, and – dismantling obligations.\n","This is the case if the contract entitles to control the use of an identified asset against payment of a fee for a certain period of time.\n","Since January 1, 2019, the group as a lessee recognizes in general for all leases within the statement of financial position an asset for the right of use of the leased assets and a liability for the lease payment commitments at present value.\n","The lease liabilities reported under financial liabilities reflect the present value of the outstanding lease payments at the time the asset is made available for use.\n","Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if it can be readily determined.\n","The lessee must allocate the contractually agreed-upon payment to the separate lease components based on the relative standalone selling price of the lease component and the aggregated standalone selling price of the non- lease components.\n","Where a dividend payment is not planned for the long term, no deferred tax liability is recognized on the difference between the proportionate net assets according to IFRS and the tax base of the investment in the subsidiary.\n","The pension commit- ment contains a retirement pay, a widow's pension as well as a disablement pension.\n","The Group pays its employees sales commissi- ons for each contract they win for the bundled sale of software and services.\n","Deferred revenue If a customer pays a consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to it, a deferred revenue item is recognised when the payment is made or becomes due.\n","Personnel expenses Amounts in KEUR 2021 2020 Wages and salaries -70,709 -66,062 Social security -13,710 -12,561 Share based

as of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations.\n","Accrued expenses Accruals are calculated by taking all identifiable risks into account and always represent the

in the consolidated balance sheet and the tax base, as well as for tax loss carry forwards.\n","Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.\n","Deferred tax is not recognized if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.\n","Where a dividend payment is not planned for the long term, no deferred tax liability is recognized on the difference between the proportionate net assets according to IFRS and the tax base of the investment in the subsidiary.\n","Currently enacted tax laws and tax laws that have been

hence to achieve >250 Cents net earnings per share until the year 2025 or 2026 - of course organic and in continuing our present dividend policy of nearly full payout to our shareholders.\n","In M+M’s view, they are ideal market segments for achieving a reasonable cost-benefit ratio of a stock exchange listing in relation to the market capitalisation, protecting the legitimate interests in transparency of the shareholders.\n","Dividend proposal 120 Cents (+20%) Management will propose to the annual shareholders’ meeting on May 11, 2022 to pay 120 Cents (PY: 100) dividend per share.\n","In addition, we would like to express our thanks to our customers, suppliers and shareholders for their continued loyalty to M+M.\n","In addition, total dividends amounting to 450 Cents have been paid out during this period, so the total value for the shareholder has improved significantly.\n","25 Statement of income Amount in KEUR Revenues Cost of materials Gross profit Personnel

company, the consoli- dated financial statement comprises all directly and indirectly owned domestic and internatio- nal subsidiaries, at which M+M SE holds direc- tly or indirectly the majority of the voting rights or the control of the economic power, which are included in accordance with the principles of full consolidation.\n","The ability to control another company generally derives from M+M direct or indirect ownership of a majority of the voting rights.\n","Inclusion of an entity’s accounts in the consoli- dated financial statements begins when the Group is able to exercise control over the entity and ceases when it is no longer able to do so.\n","The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.\n","For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.\n","The non-control- ling interest (formerly known as minority interest) was measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.\n","Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n","Non-controlling interests are valued at closing time with their share in shareholders’ equity respective earnings of the year of the particular subsidiary.\n","This is the case if the contract entitles to control the use of an identified asset against payment of a fee for a certain period of time.\n","Lease term modifications from the exercise or non-exercise of such options are only considered in the lease term if they are reasonably certain and are based on an event that is within the control of the lessee.\n","Principles of revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of products (software) and other related services is recognised when the customer obtains control of them.\n","In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n","The risk of not detec- ting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n","- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n","We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n","Our clear future target is to continue this way of sustainable and profitable growth: For 2022 we expect 144-150 Cents/share (+14-19%) net profit and plan to pay out a 135-140 Cents dividend.\n","Our mid-term goal is to double earnings in 4-5 years, hence to achieve >250 Cents net earnings per share until the year 2025 or 2026 - of course organic and in continuing our present dividend policy of nearly full payout to our shareholders.\n","Particularly in the highly complex 5-axis milling process, the hyperMILL and hyper- CAD S product lines from OPEN MIND hold a technologically leading position and allow the customers quick payback of their high machine tool investments, which are typically in the six to seven digit range.\n","It cannot be excluded, however, that the refinancing interest rate payable by M+M may develop negatively or the refinancing by debt may fail in parts or in total.\n","Dividend proposal 120 Cents (+20%) Management will propose to the annual shareholders’ meeting on May 11, 2022 to pay 120 Cents (PY: 100) dividend per share.\n","9% 1,1150 16,783 *see

approach’.\n","36 Annual report 2021 Management maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.\n","When evaluating the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts, management bases its estimates on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write-off experience, customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms.\n","Subsequent measurement depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset: - About amortized costs: Assets that are held to collect the contractual cash flows, and for which these cash flows represent exclusively interest and principal payments, are measured at amortized cost.\n","- Financial assets assessed at fair value through profit or loss: Assets that are held to collect the contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and for which the cash flows represent exclusi- vely interest and principal payments, are measured at fair value through equity.\n","The lease liabilities include the following lease payments: – Fixed payments, less lease incentives to be paid by the lessor; – variable lease payments that are based on an index or an interest rate; – expected amounts to be payable by the les- see under residual value guarantees; – the exercise price of a purchase option, if the exercise is reasonably certain and – payment of penalties for the termination of the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\n","Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, which are comprised as follows: – Lease liability, – lease payments made at or before the com- mencement date less any lease incentives received, – initial direct costs, and – dismantling obligations.\n","This is the case if the contract entitles to control the use of an identified asset against payment of a fee for a certain period of time.\n","Since January 1, 2019, the group as a lessee recognizes in general for all leases within the statement of financial position an asset for the right of use of the leased assets and a liability for the lease payment commitments at present value.\n","The lease liabilities reported under financial liabilities reflect the present value of the outstanding lease payments at the time the asset is made available for use.\n","Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if it can be readily determined.\n","The lessee must allocate the contractually agreed-upon payment to the separate lease components based on the relative standalone selling price of the lease component and the aggregated standalone selling price of the non- lease components.\n","Where a dividend payment is not planned for the long term, no deferred tax liability is recognized on the difference between the proportionate net assets according to IFRS and the tax base of the investment in the subsidiary.\n","The pension commit- ment contains a retirement pay, a widow's pension as well as a disablement pension.\n","The Group pays its employees sales commissi- ons for each contract they win for the bundled sale of software and services.\n","Deferred revenue If a customer pays a consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to it, a deferred revenue item is recognised when the payment is made or becomes due.\n","Personnel expenses Amounts in KEUR 2021 2020 Wages and salaries -70,709 -66,062 Social security -13,710 -12,561 Share based

as of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations.\n","Accrued expenses Accruals are calculated by taking all identifiable risks into account and always represent the expected repayment amount.\n","The pension commitment contains a retirement pay, a widow's pension as well as a disability pension.\n","Capital reserve The development of the capital reserve is shown
